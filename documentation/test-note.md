# Test Note

This is a test note to verify that company colors work correctly.

I had a meeting with Alice Johnson from the design team. She mentioned that Bob Wilson from engineering is working on the new deployment pipeline.

Carol Davis from marketing is planning the next campaign launch.

These people should have underlines in the company color #b5e550 (green).

Let me also mention John Doe and Jane Smith from the example company, which should have blue underlines (#0066cc).
